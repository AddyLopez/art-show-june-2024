      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Addy López is a drummer, caregiver, organizer, and software developer
        with deep roots in New Mexico. Queer liberation is a matter of deep
        personal significance to them, as a non-binary lesbian, as is the
        importance of intersectional collective struggle. Although their
        creative practice chiefly revolves around music, they enjoy working on
        projects that buck conventional definitions of art and that are marked
        by qualities of originality, inventiveness, and insight drawn from a
        creative process infused with experimentation and unabating
        contemplation.
