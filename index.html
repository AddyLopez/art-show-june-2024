          <h2>About the Artist</h2>
          <p>
            Addy López is a drummer, caregiver, organizer, and software
            developer with deep roots in New Mexico. Queer liberation is a
            matter of deep personal significance to them, as a non-binary
            lesbian, as is the importance of intersectional collective struggle.
            Although their creative practice chiefly revolves around music, they
            enjoy working on projects that buck conventional definitions of art
            or beauty and that are marked by qualities of originality,
            inventiveness, and insight drawn from a creative process infused
            with experimentation and unabating contemplation.
