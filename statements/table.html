    <h1>Solidarity Table</h1>
    <p>
      This intimate table brings the queer community and the Palestinian
      resistance together in its design motifs and exists for the sake of
      holding revolutionary conversations that center the everyday strategizing
      of collective resistance to oppression and the envisioning of liberated
      futures.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the legs and supporting structural beams feature the colors of the
      Progress Pride flag–red, yellow, orange, green, blue, purple, pink, light
      blue, black, brown, and white–which offer an important corrective to the
      six-colored rainbow flag because they are inclusive of trans people and
      people of color who have historically been marginalized even within the
      queer liberation movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table-top features the fishnet, olive leaves, and stripes
      (representing Palestinians’ connection to the sea, relationship to the
      land, and historical trade routes, respectively) which form the three
      major design motifs from the keffiyeh. The keffiyeh has become an icon of
      the Palestinian resistance worldwide and is often worn by those wishing to
      express solidarity with their struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arranged so, the table symbolizes solidarity and commitment to shared
      struggle by representing the queer community uplifting the Palestinian
      resistance.
