        <h1>Brick Necklaces: Icons of Resistance</h1>
        <p class="date">June 28, 2024</p>
        <p>
          Made especially for Pride 2024, these iconic brick necklaces pay
          homage to the radical foundations of the queer liberation movement in
          the historic Stonewall Riots. They promote pride in identity,
          inclusion, respect, and a broader capacity amongst our community and
          allies to recognize various sub-identities and historic subcultures.
          In developing this visual literacy, these necklaces open the door for
          us all to deepen our understanding of one another and therefore build
          more-resilient communities.

          The brick is an icon of resistance that has taken on a nearly
          mythological role in the origin story of queer liberation. To me, the
          brick symbolizes a liberatory politics of refusal. The act of
          resistance encapsulated by the throwing of the brick represents a
          fundamental rejection of any deterministic coercion against our
          freedom–whether external in the form of police oppression, or
          internalized through oppressive self-disciplining. In this light, the
          brick invites us to think about not only what we refuse on the level
          of our being but, importantly, also what we build through that
          refusal.

          Here, the miniaturization of the brick (made by an artisan with real
          concrete at a 1:6 scale) lends a kitschy, camp aesthetic and
          transforms this symbol into an intimate piece of jewelry that is
          precious like a locket. It becomes an intimate reminder, worn closely
          on the body, of the stakes of insisting on personal and collective
          freedom.

          Icons throughout history often come to hold many contested meanings.
          For example, the crucifix has been weaponized historically to justify
          the medieval Crusades; and yet, that particular use does not empty out
          its personal significance for millions of Christians who wear it as a
          devotional icon of their own faith. The Pride flag as an icon is not
          exempt from that complexity, as a field of contested meanings.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a time when queer identities have been co-opted by corporations for
          the profit of the few and weaponized through pinkwashing to justify
          the U.S. and Israel’s imperialist genocide in Palestine, it is crucial
          to recuperate the radical politics and meanings at the heart of Pride.
          We must wrest control of the meanings of our icons away from predatory
          corporate interests and warmongers. We need to move beyond merely
          identifying as queer–or beyond a superficial, performative
          allyship–and to engage with others shoulder to shoulder in building
          the liberated futures we all deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this end, I submit each necklace as a secular devotional icon. May
          these necklaces serve as a reminder of the rich legacy we have
          inherited as queer people, and inspire us as individuals to devote
          ourselves to carrying on that legacy through a personal commitment to
          collective struggle.
