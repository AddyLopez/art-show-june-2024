          <h1>Brick Necklaces: Icons of Resistance</h1>
          <p class="date">June 28, 2024</p>
          <p>
            Made especially for Pride 2024, these iconic brick necklaces pay
            homage to the radical foundations of the queer liberation movement
            in the historic Stonewall Riots. They promote pride in identity,
            inclusion, respect, and a broader capacity amongst our community and
            allies to recognize various sub-identities and historic subcultures.
            In developing this visual literacy, these necklaces open the door
            for us all to deepen our understanding of one another and therefore
            build more-resilient communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brick is an icon of resistance that has taken on a nearly
            mythological role in the origin story of queer liberation. To me,
            the brick symbolizes a liberatory politics of refusal. The act of
            resistance encapsulated by the throwing of the brick represents a
            fundamental rejection of any deterministic coercion against our
            freedom–whether external in the form of police oppression, or
            internalized through oppressive self-disciplining. In this light,
            the brick invites us to think about not only what we refuse on the
            level of our being but also, importantly, what we build through that
            refusal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, the miniaturization of the brick (made by an artisan with real
            concrete at a 1:6 scale) lends a kitschy, camp aesthetic and
            transforms this symbol into an intimate piece of jewelry that is
            precious like a locket. It becomes an intimate reminder, worn
            closely on the body, of the stakes of insisting on personal and
            collective freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Icons throughout history often come to hold many contested meanings.
            For example, the crucifix has been weaponized historically to
            justify various atrocities, such as the medieval Crusades; and yet,
            that particular use does not empty out its personal significance for
            millions of Christians who wear it as a devotional icon of their own
            faith. The Pride flag as an icon is not exempt from that complexity,
            as a field of contested meanings.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a time when queer identities have been co-opted by corporations
            for the profit of the few and weaponized through pinkwashing to
            justify the U.S. and Israel’s imperialist genocide in Palestine, it
            is crucial to recuperate the radical politics and meanings at the
            heart of Pride. We must wrest control of the meanings of our icons
            away from predatory corporate interests and warmongers. We need to
            move beyond merely identifying as queer–or beyond a superficial,
            performative allyship–and to engage with others shoulder to shoulder
            in building the liberated futures we all deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this end, I submit each necklace as a secular devotional icon.
            May these necklaces serve as a reminder of the rich legacy we have
            inherited as queer people, and inspire us as individuals to devote
            ourselves to carrying on that legacy through a personal commitment
            to collective struggle.
